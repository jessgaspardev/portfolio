    <p>I started learning how to draw and paint in 2024 after spending all my life believing I just didn't have the talent and couldn't learn. I'm not good yet by any means but it's amazing how much is possible to do by learning fundamentals and just practice. Lately I haven't had as much time to practice as I had when I started, but it's one of my favorite hobbies now. This is a collection of digital oil paintings I've created using <Link href="krita.org" text="Krita" variant="newWindow"/>.</p>
