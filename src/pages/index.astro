<Layout title="Home" heading="Hi, I'm Jess! 👋">
	<section class="text">
		<p>Welcome to my home on the World Wide Web! I’m an independent web developer working from Portugal. Currently, I’m a web engineer and technical developer at <Link href="https://greatsealstudios.com" text="Great Seal Studios" />, while working other <Link href="/projects" text="projects" />. I’m an advocate for remote work and open-source software.</p>
		<p>When I’m not working, I like to sketch and paint, play video games, watch basketball, and read fantasy/sci-fi books.</p>
