- Seeing Microsoft’s attempt to push AI slop down our throats with Windows 11 finally made me switch to Linux as my operating system and I couldn’t be happier :);
- I’ve been using Astro to build websites for a while now (and I absolutely love it!) but I’m taking Chris Pennington’s Astro course to go deeper in my knowledge of this framework;
- I’m working on building this website you’re currently reading;
- Also started planning a new project I want to build in near future;
- Trying to get out of my reading slump but it’s been difficult to focus on any book lately... but I need to read Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, especially now after watching Guillermo Del Toro’s film;
- Both my PS5 controllers have stick drift (lucky me...) and I don’t want to spend money on a new one right now, so I’m only playing PS4 games at the moment which led me to replay Dark Souls 2, and damn, it really is amazing (I know that’s a hot take but it shouldn’t be!);
