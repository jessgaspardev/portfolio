- I'm learning Svelte! My big goal for this year is to stop being scared of backend development and evolve from frontend developer to full-stack. I've had my issues with React and I'm quickly falling in love with Svelte. As someone who is used to Astro to build content-driven websites, Svelte's structure and syntax seems to be the most similar, so I've very excited about learning this framework and leave React's mess behind.

- I have plans for various apps I want to build. I want to start with what I think will be the easiest one, an online dnd journal app for players to keep track of everything that has to do with their characters.

- I also want to build a website directory for classic sci-fi books, I think it could be a fun project to flex my Astro skills.

- I'm happy to say my reading slump is over! I just finished reading Ammonite by Nicola Griffith (It was amazing!) and I'm about to (finally) start reading Frankenstein by Mary Shelley.

- Movies are back in my life too. I only watched 9 movies last year if you can believe it. Just had other interests, I guess. But now I've already watched 6 during these first two weeks of the year!
